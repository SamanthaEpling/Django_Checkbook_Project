This project was included with a recent upgrade to the Python Course offered by The Tech Academy.

I was instructed to use the IDE PyCharm, but I thought I would take this opportunity to really understand the upgrades available using Visual Studio 19. 
I know how to make migrations, migrate, and runserver from the command linen using PyCharm, but it was really simple to switch to using Visual Studio to accomplish the same
thing.

So as to focus on learning the Python/Django setup, files for static and templates were provided.

Most of the changes/edits were made to creating the new app in the project and updating the models, views, urls, migrations.

More insightful descriptions to be provided in the future. Thanks for reading!
